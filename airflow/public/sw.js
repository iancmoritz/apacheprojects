// Airflow's UI is a stock single-page app that fetches /_airflow/api/v2/... over HTTP; it has no
// idea there is no server.  This worker answers every request under /_airflow/ from the Pyodide
// runtime instead of the network: it forwards them over a MessagePort to the page, which owns the
// runtime.  The prefix is deliberately not /airflow/ -- that is the page hosting all of this, and
// the static host has to keep serving it.
